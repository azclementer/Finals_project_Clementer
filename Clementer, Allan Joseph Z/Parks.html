                    you have to visit Mines View Park. This park sits on a ridge on the northeast side of Baguio. 
                    Exploring the park is one of the recommended leisure activities in Baguio.

                    Baguio. It also houses nurseries dedicated to propagating flora that will eventually be replanted in 
                    the parks and gardens of Baguio.
